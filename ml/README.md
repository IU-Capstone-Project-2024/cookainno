## Ingredients detection model progress

Week 2: Research - choosing a model and searching for a good dataset (didn't find). Starting collect images for dataset.

Week 3: YOLOv8m model trained on Retail Store Dataset. Export model and created script for deploying model.

Future work: Collect more data for our particular CV problem - detect ingredients.
