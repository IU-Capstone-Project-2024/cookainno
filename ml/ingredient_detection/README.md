## Ingredients detection model


### Installation

1. Install python version 3.11.
2. Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install requirements.
3. Set ```image_path``` and ```confidence``` in the code and run it.

Probably it would be better to create script that accept ```image_path``` and ```confidence``` as arguments.

### Progress

Week 2: Research - choosing a model and searching for a good dataset (didn't find). Starting collect images for dataset.

Week 3: YOLOv8m model trained on Retail Store Dataset. Export model and created script for deploying model.

Future work: Collect more data for our particular CV problem - detect ingredients.
